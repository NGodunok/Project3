## Section 1: Project Breakdown, Work Division, Communication Plan

### Project Breakdown

This project is a Python app that shows stock data charts using the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). The user can:

- Type a stock symbol (like AAPL or MSFT)
- Pick a chart type (line or bar)
- Choose a time series (like daily, weekly, monthly, intraday)
- Pick a start and end date
- See a graph in their browser

The API gives us historical stock data (up to 20 years). We filter the data by date and show it using `matplotlib`. The main goal was to build a working app and also learn to use **Jira for Scrum** and **GitHub for code**.

We planned the project over 3 weeks with different sprints.


### Work Division and Planning

We used [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to keep track of everything we needed to do. We made tasks and moved them across our Scrum board like this:

- To Do  
- In Progress  
- In Review  
- Done

Some of our main tasks in Jira were:

- Write use case descriptions  
- Create the use case diagram  
- Add example code from Alpha Vantage  
- Create the GitHub repo  
- Handle errors for wrong input, connection issues, and parsing  
- Build the Python code  
- Break big to-do items into smaller ones  
- Format the output graph  
- Write the report and divide it into sections  
- Final submission of report and GitHub repo

Everyone helped on different parts of the project and we updated our progress in Jira often.


### Communication Plan

We used **Discord** to talk and plan. 

Jira helped us stay organized, and GitHub made it easy to work on code as a team with branches and commits. It helped us keep everything in one place and work smoothly together.
